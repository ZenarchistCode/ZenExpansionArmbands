What Is This?

This mod adds craftable Expansion Flag armbands to the game.

Requires Expansion Basebuilding or Bundle mod as it uses the flag assets from Expansion.

Craft the armbands like any other armband (use a sharp object on the flag).

The mod includes the types.xml and Armbands.json config for the Expansion trader.

Installation Instructions:

Install this mod like any other mod - copy it into your server folder and add it to your mods list. Make sure to copy the .bikey into your server keys if you're not using a server management tool like OmegaManager which does that automatically.

Make sure to merge the types.xml into your server's Expansion types and adjust as required, or the items will despawn on server restart and/or if no players are around. The types.xml and trader JSON file is in the mod folder.

Credits:

Expansion team. All I did was add armband types that use their flag textures.

Repack & Source Code:

You can repack this mod if you like, and do anything else you want with it for that matter. It's just an unbinarized .cpp file.

Enjoy!
